			<p>My name is Teagen Treutel and this is my website and first project for LIS 351. On this website I will be introducing and describing me and important aspects of my life which include my family, freinds, and pets. Some general information about me is that I am currently an undergraduate student at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> and I am currently a freshman.  I was born and grew up in Wisconsin, Wisconsin Rapids which is located directly in the middle of the state. Some hobbies of mine include snowboarding, BMX racing, and Weightlifting. </p>
