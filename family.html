		<h2>About my family</h2>
		<p>Me and my family have lived in Wisconsin Rapids our whole lives.  We live on an excluded part of town convered by thousands of acres worth of trees.  My mom works as a nurse in Stevens Point, My dad works as a mechanic in Stevens Point as well, My brother is two years older than me and attends school at the university of Stevens Point, and my sister is twelve years old and just started middle school.  As a family we all share a common interest of BMX racing, we have all had a part in it for about 15 years, ever since my brother and I were little.</p>
