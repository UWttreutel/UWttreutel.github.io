<p>My pet dog's name is Lola, shes been a part of our family for eleven years so far.  She is an enlgish lab which is a slightly different breed from a yellow lab.  English labs have a slightly different shade of fur where is it a shade more white than a yellow lab.  Our family initially wanted her to be a hunting dog but unforntunately she never became one because she gained too much weight.  Yet as an eleven year old dog Lola is still extremely healthy and is happy as she can be.</p>
